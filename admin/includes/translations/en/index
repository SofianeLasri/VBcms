	To start, choose a theme and upload images via the <b>Gallery</b> page, then go to <b>General settings</b> to set the background images. Don't forget to create a multitude of <b>tips</b> so that the player doesn't have to see the same one several times.<i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i></p>
<p>If you have any questions or find a bug, don't hesitate to let me know. I will correct the problem as soon as possible.<br>
